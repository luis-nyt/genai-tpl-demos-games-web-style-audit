# Contributing
Thanks for contributing to TPL Web! Here’s what to consider when making changes to the library. Feel free to reach out in [\#times-product-language](https://nytimes.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03TAAK4QQ7) with further questions.

## General Guidelines
- Components and styles are **accessible at launch** — not after!
- **Lean into web standards:** “Use the platform” where possible, rather than reinventing the wheel.
- **Consider cross-platform:** Use shared language, [design tokens](https://github.com/nytimes/design-tokens) and concepts where appropriate, so that TPL reflects a set of underlying design principles whether on iOS, Android, Figma or here on the web.
- **Aim for scale:** Build software that’s flexible and speaks to 2-3 teams’ needs, rather than focusing on one specific product surface or feature.
- **Use [Pretty Lights](#className-prop)** to style components…*for now!*
