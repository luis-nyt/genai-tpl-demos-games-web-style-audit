# Box + Flex

`Box` and `Flex` are two components that empower you to flexibly and responsively lay out your components
without the need for any CSS. `Box` and `Flex`:

- are responsive by design
- use the space scale as first class unit
- have a terse, easy to read interface
- make it easy to reason about responsive spacing without having to context-switch between css and jsx
- polymorphic; can use an "as" prop to change the underlying markup

example:

```js
import { Flex, Box } from '@nyt/tpl';

<Flex flexWrap="wrap" marginBottom={1} justifyContent="space-between">
  <Box flex={[1, 0.5]}>Some content</Box>
  <Box as="aside" flex={[1, 0.45]}>
    Some more content
  </Box>
</Flex>;
```
