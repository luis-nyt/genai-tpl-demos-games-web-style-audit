# @nyt/tpl

`@nyt/tpl` is a React-based web implementation of [Times Product Language (TPL)](https://coda.io/d/Times-Product-Language-TPL_dH9ZFEaJR9I).

**Big changes are coming to TPL Web!** Please see [TPL Web 2.0 Deprecation Notices](?path=/docs/tpl-web-2-0-deprecation-notices--docs) and the [TPL Web 2.0 Release Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12T5bEefMJDYoLY8gtg0cokrNco53h5t8Ofj8rn5uaV4/edit?tab=t.2tb2mnrxg2u6) for more information.

# Getting Started

## Installation

If you use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in your local development environment, install `@nyt/tpl` and its peer dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm i --save @nyt/tpl @babel/runtime pretty-lights prop-types react
```

You can also install it with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
pnpm add @nyt/tpl @babel/runtime pretty-lights prop-types react
```

_`@nyt/tpl` is a private package. To access it, please see the JS+Web CoP's docs on [Accessing private packages](https://web.tech.nyt.net/resources/private-packages/)._

## Render the Root component

After installing, import and render `@nyt/tpl`'s `Root` component at the root of your project:

```jsx
import { Root } from '@nyt/tpl';

export const App = () => (
  <Root>
    <div>Hello, world</div>
  </Root>
)
```

This `Root` component sets up key parts of the `@nyt/tpl` library:

- CSS variable declarations for color and typography tokens
- A React context provider for breakpoints
- Dark Mode support (enabled by default)
- Accessible focus styles for all child elements
