# Switcher

Sometimes you want a layout to _switch_ between a stacked vertical layout and flex layout. This can be easily achieved
using the [Flex](/docs/layout-box-flex--page) component, but this relies on media queries; it switches layouts based
on the width of the screen.

Often, however, we want the layout to change based on the width of element container. `Switcher` wraps a `Flex` component
with one key addition: it takes a `switchWidth` parameter which dictates at which container width the child elements
should reconfigure themselves between a stacked layout and a flex row.

Children of Switcher may set a `max-width` property to constrain their width. The `Box` component and its `maxWidth`
property work well here.

See [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/switcher/) for more about the inspiration for, and the theory behind
this component.
