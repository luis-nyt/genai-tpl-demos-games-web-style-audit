# Intro to Story List

Learn about the views that make up TPL Story List and try them out for the first time.

## Section 1: Create a Story List

Let's make a story list and fill it with a few items to start.

### Step 1

First, create a `<StoryList>` with three `<div>` elements within it.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section1Step1} sourceState="shown" />

Hey, thatâ€™s cool â€” `<StoryList>` automatically inserts dividers in between items for us.

### Step 2

Replace the `<div>`s with `<StoryListItem>`.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section1Step2} sourceState="shown" />

`<StoryListItem>` adds padding, so the text is now aligned with the dividers and no longer crashes in to the left edge of the container.

### Step 3

Wrap each of the text strings in `<StoryListItemContent>`.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section1Step3} sourceState="shown" />

Holy cannoli, weâ€™ve got headlines now! We can see here that ``<StoryListItemContent>``â€™s `children` prop corresponds to the story headline.

### Step 4

Add a `topLabel` or "kicker" to each content component.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section1Step4} sourceState="shown" />

### Step 5

Add a `summary` to each of the ``<StoryListItemContent>`` components.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section1Step5} sourceState="shown" />

Like the headline and top label, `summary` has a default look. Weâ€™ll learn how to customize this later.

### Step 6

Add links to each story with `<LinkBox>` and `<LinkBox.Link subtle>`.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section1Step6} sourceState="shown" />

`<LinkBox>` makes the whole story clickable while still following best practices for **accessibility** and HTML semantics.

----

_At this point weâ€™ve seen that TPL Story List is a family of views that work together. Our list is off to a great start!_
