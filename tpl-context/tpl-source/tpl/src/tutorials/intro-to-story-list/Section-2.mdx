# Intro to Story List

Learn about the views that make up TPL Story List and try them out for the first time.

## Section 2: Add Media to Story List Items

See what we can do with media and positioning.

### Step 1

Letâ€™s add an image to the first item, using `<StoryListItem>`â€™s `media` prop.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section2Step1} sourceState="shown" />

The image is a bit big, but it shows us that `<StoryListItem>` doesnâ€™t have an opinion on media sizing.

### Step 2

Set the first itemâ€™s `mediaPosition` prop to `'top'` and add `width: 100%` to the first image.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section2Step2} sourceState="shown" />

This big promo image at the top of the list looks good, but what about **full bleed**?

### Step 3

Change the `mediaPosition` to `'topFullBleed'`.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section2Step3} sourceState="shown" />

The `mediaPosition` prop has several other options. You can turn on full bleed _just like that(!)_ with most of them.

### Step 4

Add `media` to the other items in the list.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section2Step4} sourceState="shown" />

Here we can see that `'trailing'` is the default media position. (Well, kind of.)

### Step 5

Add `width: 95px` to the other itemsâ€™ images.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section2Step5} sourceState="shown" />

Once again, story list item doesnâ€™t have an opinion on media sizing, so itâ€™s up to us!

_Our story list now has a lively mix of text and images. What about sections? Typography? What else can we do here?_
