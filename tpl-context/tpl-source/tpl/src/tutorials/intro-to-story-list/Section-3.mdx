# Intro to Story List

Learn about the views that make up TPL Story List and try them out for the first time.

## Section 3: Sections & Typography

Add additional structure and visual interest to our story list.

### Step 1

Wrap the first item’s `<LinkBox.Link>`, which contains the headline, in `<HeadlineFeature as="h3" size={28}>`.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section3Step1} sourceState="shown" />

`<HeadlineFeature>` is one of several TPL [typography](/docs/typography-overview--docs) components, by the way!

You can pass any element you want to `<StoryListItemContent>`, and thus you can customize typography, **HTML semantics**, text color and more, just as you would with any other child element.

### Step 2

Wrap the other two `<LinkBox.Link>` elements in `<h3>` tags.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section3Step2} sourceState="shown" />

Here in Storybook, at least, the `<h3>` elements still have some browser default styling applied to them, so let’s fix that.

### Step 3

Add `style={{ fontWeight: 'inherit', margin: 0 }}` to the `<h3>` tags.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section3Step3} sourceState="shown" />

You can also use any of TPL’s [typography](/docs/typography-overview--docs) components, of course.

### Step 4

Wrap the last two items in a `<StoryListSection>`.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section3Step4} sourceState="shown" />

The section adds a heavier divider and, since it comes after the first story, additional spacing.

### Step 5

Finally, add a `header` to the section.

<Canvas of={IntroStories.Section3Step5} sourceState="shown" />

As with other views in this tutorial, the section header comes with default typography.

_At this point, we’ve explored most of TPL Story List’s core concepts, which make building lists of stories efficient, polished, flexible _and_ **accessible**._
